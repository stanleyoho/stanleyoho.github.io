# Week 1 - Big Tech Prep Journey Begins
Date: 2025-09-01  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Weekly Goals
- [ ] Solve 5 LeetCode problems (Array / HashMap)  
- [ ] Build a simple Todo List App using Jetpack Compose  
- [ ] Write and record a 2-minute English self-introduction  
- [ ] Publish the first blog post outlining the 16-week roadmap  

---

## ðŸ“… Daily Plan & Review

### Day 1 (Mon)
**Focus:** Kickoff + Setup  
- [ ] Solve LeetCode: *Two Sum* (Array)  
- [ ] Setup Android project with Jetpack Compose template  
- [ ] Draft outline of English self-introduction (background + strengths + achievements)  
- [ ] Create skeleton for Blog outline  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Review**  
- Problem: *Two Sum*  
- Key Idea: Use HashMap to check complement in O(n).  
- Mistake / Learning: Initially used nested loop â†’ O(nÂ²). Refactored to HashMap â†’ O(n).  
- Reference: [LeetCode Note - Two Sum](./leetcode/two-sum.md)  

---

### Day 2 (Tue)
**Focus:** HashMap + Todo App Core  
- [ ] Solve LeetCode: *Valid Anagram* (HashMap)  
- [ ] Build basic UI for Todo App (Add/Delete task)  
- [ ] Expand self-intro draft into full 2-minute script  
- [ ] Record rough audio (first attempt)  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Review**  
- Problem: *Valid Anagram*  
- Key Idea: Count chars using HashMap â†’ compare.  
- Mistake / Learning: Forgot to handle Unicode input.  
- Reference: Inline note OR external article link.  

---

### Day 3 (Wed)
**Focus:** State Management + Writing  
- [ ] Solve LeetCode: *Contains Duplicate* (Array/Set)  
- [ ] Implement state management in Todo App (rememberSaveable / MutableState)  
- [ ] Practice self-intro out loud, aim for ~90 seconds fluency  
- [ ] Draft Blog Post #1 â€” *My 16-Week Big Tech Preparation Plan*  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Review**  
- Problem: *Contains Duplicate*  
- Key Idea: Use Set to track seen elements.  
- Insight: Learned how to reason about HashSet vs sorting trade-off.  

---

### Day 4 (Thu)
**Focus:** Styling + Recording  
- [ ] Solve LeetCode: *Group Anagrams* (HashMap + Sorting)  
- [ ] Add Material3 styling to Todo App UI  
- [ ] Re-record self-intro, target â‰¥ 90% fluency  
- [ ] Post Compose Todo App snippet to GitHub  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Review**  
- Problem: *Group Anagrams*  
- Key Idea: Sort each string â†’ group by key.  
- Learning: Tried to use HashMap<CharCountSignature, List<String>> for optimization.  

---

### Day 5 (Fri)
**Focus:** Final Problem + Polish  
- [ ] Solve LeetCode: *Product of Array Except Self* (Prefix/Suffix)  
- [ ] Test Add/Delete features in Todo App (verify updates correctly)  
- [ ] Memorize self-intro script, practice until smooth delivery  
- [ ] Publish Blog Post #1 (Roadmap + first reflections)  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Review**  
- Problem: *Product of Array Except Self*  
- Key Idea: Prefix & Suffix multiplication, avoid division.  
- Learning: Careful about integer overflow â†’ used long type.  

---

### Day 6 (Sat)
**Focus:** Review & Refactor  
- [ ] Review all 5 LeetCode problems and solutions  
- [ ] Record yourself explaining solutions in English  
- [ ] Refactor Compose Todo App code (improve readability/structure)  
- [ ] Upload final Todo App version to GitHub  

**ðŸ”Ž LeetCode Weekly Review**  
- Strengths: Array + HashMap concepts are now faster.  
- Weaknesses: Need more practice with edge cases & Unicode handling.  
- Reflection: Next week â†’ focus on Stack / Queue / Binary Search.  

---

### Day 7 (Sun)
**Focus:** Reflection & Wrap-up  
- [ ] Write *Weekly Reflection* (challenges, insights, improvements)  
- [ ] Verify checklist:  
  - [ ] 5 LeetCode problems done  
  - [ ] Compose Todo App (CRUD) completed  
  - [ ] English self-intro recorded  
  - [ ] Blog Post #1 published  
- [ ] Publish *Week 1 Reflection* on Blog  

**ðŸ”Ž Weekly Reflection**  
- Hardest Problem: *Product of Array Except Self*  
- Biggest Win: Finished Compose Todo App with CRUD.  
- English: Self-intro recording is fluent ~90%.  
- Next Focus: Deeper dive into Coroutines + Flow.  

---

## ðŸ“š Learning Notes
- Writing English reviews for LeetCode helps reinforce concepts.  
- Jetpack Compose state management is tricky but rewarding.  
- Speaking English while explaining solutions feels awkward at first, but improves fluency.
